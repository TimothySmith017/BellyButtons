# BellyButtons
The purpose of this project was to help Roza and her team figure out the prevalence of different types of bacteria that are residing in people's bellybuttons. This data would be used to determine which bacteria could be used to create an acceptable meat substitude for her company.

In order to display this data in a clean way, we needed to figure out how to manipulate Javascript and Plotly to create appealing data visualizations that would make the prevalence of different bellybutton bacteria easy to identify. To do this, we took the sample data from Roza's initial studies and used Javascript to read through it. In order to make it easy to view each participant's data, we learned how to host a file on a webserver and to create a dropdown menu that would have each participant parsed through it so that Roza and the team can easily slect through different participants to view the data.

Next we had to manipulate and sort through the data to get the top 10 bacteria from each sample participant. After using methods such as .slice() to get this data, I could then create my variables to get the bar chart set up and formatted correctly. I could use similar techniques to set up the bubble chart as an additional visualization to be used.

Lastly, I wanted it to be easy for everyone on Roza's team to quickly access the dashboard, so we hosted it online by using githubpages so that it could be in a public sevrer.
